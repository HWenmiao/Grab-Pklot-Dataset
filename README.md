# Grab-Pklot-Dataset

**Grab-Pklot** is an satellite-based contextual enriched dataset for large-scale parking-lot detection. It consists of 1,344 1024 × 1024 satellite images in Singapore, with a ground sampling distance of 0.3 meter/pixel. Each training sample is consisted of a satellite image, the annotation of parking-lots and multi-channel contextual infomration of road and buildings within the same-area. More details can be found in our paper [A Context-enriched Satellite Imagery Dataset and an Approach for Parking Lot Detection.](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2022/papers/Yin_A_Context-Enriched_Satellite_Imagery_Dataset_and_an_Approach_for_Parking_WACV_2022_paper.pdf) This dataset can be request for non-profit academic research.
